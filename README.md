## Assumptions/liberties
1. Developed this project only for Images however it may be expanded to include gif & strip of images\
2. For Image upload, I am currently using Image-URL as input instead of file for file upload because we are now a day using AWS and other services to store files and at the end it gives us Image-URL\
3. Here, We Do not have Login/Register Functionality so hardcoded a profile user\
4. At Form validation, I validated form using simple validations also we can easily accomplish the same thing with a react-hook form and yup or another library.
